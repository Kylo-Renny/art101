			<h1>Lab 10 - Javascript for the Web</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to create a function that randomly generated text given a string of words and an array of parameters.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a hard time originally figuring out how to write the code, but with help during lecture and with my TA, I was able to put together a function and know what it is supposed to look like. This enabled me to be able to recognize where my code broke during my first attempt at this lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the file I created as well as the program executed, edited with CSS to make it look snazzy and match the previous labs aesthetic. I even added a parameter to ensure every first character in each message is uppercase to resemble proper grammar in texting.</p>

			<h3>Script Output</h3>
