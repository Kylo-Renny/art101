			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I once again worked with Grace to experiment with basic JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I couldn't understand why my Javascript file was giving me red error messages but it turns out that I was using = signs instead of :. The more I learn about different coding types, the more I mix them up when I am writing code which is something my TA also mentioned they do now that they know so many coding languages. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the file I created as well as the program executed, edited with CSS to make it look snazzy and match the previous labs aesthetic.</p>

			<h3>Script Output</h3>
