			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I once again worked with Grace to experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I couldn't understand why my Javascript file was not connecting to my main html after I wrote my code and it took my a while of fuddling with it to figure out the issue. I had forgotten I had renamed my folders to correspond to the lab number they were apart of. I hadn't made the lab source in my html match the right javascript number and it was a broken link. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the file I created as well as the program executed, edited with CSS to make it look snazzy and match the previous labs aesthetic.</p>
