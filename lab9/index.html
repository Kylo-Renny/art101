					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This was extremely frustrating, even with the extra time given. Sometimes it takes a while to load once it is uploaded into the Master on my webpage. </p>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Sometimes the buttons do not work. I can't seem to figure out CSS no matter how much time I spent on it.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="results" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the file I created as well as the program executed, edited with CSS to make it look snazzy and match the previous labs aesthetic.</p>
