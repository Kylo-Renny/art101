			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I think the biggest challenge was trying to configure CSS to best format the lists without it looking too out of place. That and the intro to JS was interesting as I have never pseudocoded anything before. I think I have made detailed lists of what I have to do, but nothing like this.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have any issues other than the getting used to all of the different recipes and codeing starters. Everything is different which makes sense but I still get confused more often than naught when writing up these files.  </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Pseudocoding an Everyday Task
						<ol>
							<li>Find another car</li>
							<li>Connect Jumper Cables</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Attach red to red of your battery, then red to red of the other car</li>
							<li>Attach black to black of the other car, then black to metal part of dead battery
							</li>
						</ul>
							<li>Start the other Cars Engine</li>
							<li>Start the Dead Car</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Accelerate a bit on other car if jumpstart does not work after few tries</li>
						</ul>
							<li>Take Cables out in Reverse Order</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						Pseudocoding the Dinosaur Game
						<ol>
							<li>Generate a Desert Landscape
								<ul>
									<li>Include Cacti in varying groups of 1 to 4</li>
									<li>Include Birds</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Create Dinosaur Character</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Include Animation for Running, Jumping, Ducking, and Death</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Implement Controls</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Space Button Starts Game and used for Jumping</li>
									<li>Down Arrow for Ducking</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Create Variables</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Implement randomizer for Cacti and Bird obstacles</li>
									<li>Score begins at 0 and increases by distance Dinosaur goes</li>
								</ul>
						</ol>
