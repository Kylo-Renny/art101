//Pseudocoding the Dinosaur Game
//Generate a Desert Landscape
  //Include Cacti in varying groups of 1 to 4 
  //Include Birds 
//Create Dinosaur Character
  //Include Animation for Running, Jumping, Ducking, and Death 
//Implement Controls
  //Main game loop:
    //while the game is not over:
    //Check for user input (e.g., spacebar to jump)
    //Update dinosaur's position and animation:
    //Apply gravity to the dinosaur's vertical position
    //Keep the dinosaur above the ground:
//Create Variables
  //Initialize game variables:
    //Dinosaur position (x, y)
    // Ground height
    //Game speed
    //Score
    //Obstacle list
    //Implement randomizer for Cacti and Bird obstacles
    //Score begins at 0 and increases by distance Dinosaur goes 
    //Move obstacles from right to left       
    //Check for collisions:
      //Check if the dinosaur collides with any obstacle
    //If there's a collision, end the game
  //Game over:
  //Display a game over message
  //Show the final score
    //Allow the player to restart the game if desired


// this is an example function and this comment tells what it doees and what parameters are passed to it.
function myFunction(param1, param2) {
  // some code here
  // return results;
}

function main() {
  console.log("Main function started.");
  // the code that makes everything happen
}

// let's get this party started
main();
