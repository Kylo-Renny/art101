			<h1>Lab 12- Conditionals</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had to leave early this week for the holiday so I missed out on the class where this was explained so my biggest problem will be trying to learn how to do it on my own. Having this due the day after a holiday also put a bigger time crunch on everything.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the file I created as well as the program executed, edited with CSS to make it look snazzy and match the previous labs aesthetic.</p>
