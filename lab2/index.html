            <h1>Lab 2 - HTML and CSS Starter</h1>
            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ren and I am a fourth year Art major focusing on costume and prop design. 
                In my free time I like to play Dungeons and Dragons and listen to paranormal podcasts. 
                My lab parnter's name is Jazmine and she is a third year FDM major that enjoys video editing. 
                We are both in different Sections but that didn't stop us from coming together and finishing our lab!</p>
                <div class="minor selection">
                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                     <p>In my opinion, the biggest challenge of this lab was trying to figure out CSS on my own.
                        It was harder to find a lab partner compared to last week's lab and due to one of our lecture classes being cancelled
                        without much information about CSS to go on, it was more or less a weekend of trial and error. 
                     </p>
                </div>

                <div class="minor selection">
                    <h3>Problems</h3>
                     <p> The biggest problem I had was trying to link the CSS file to my Html and needed to get help from my section TA. 
                    That as well as the learning curve of trying to figure out a brand new recipe to coding once I was just starting to get used to Html.
                     </p>

                <div class="minor selection">
                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>As someone who enjoys being ahead of schedule, I enjoyed being able to create my own Html index and build a website from scratch
                        zt my own pace before having to work with a partner. I was able to link it to my Homepage as well which I thought was pretty neat.
                        Being able to see the finished product really helps motivate me to do better for the next Lab as I watch it all come together. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>I put both my own written code as well as the provided lab file outline into one consolidated file and was able to find a partner to critique
                        my coding at the last minute. I think it looks pretty snazzy. 
                    </p>
