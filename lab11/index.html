					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to create a function that generated an anagram given any string with an array of parameters.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a hard time originally figuring out how to write the code, but with help during lecture and with my TA, I was able to put together a function and know what it is supposed to look like. This enabled me to be able to recognize where breaks and my code were as well as where I can implement new compontents to my webpage and in what order they need to be in. I was even able to add a prompt that allowed the user to be notified to go find the change in the webpage as a form of interaction between the user and the result.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the file I created as well as the program executed, edited with CSS to make it look snazzy and match the previous labs aesthetic.</p>

			<h3>Script Output</h3>
			<p>Write something in the box below! It can be anything! Your Name, a Joke- whatever you'd like and I'll do something silly with it!</p>
