			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions & Callbacks</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Work with a partner to create Anon Functions and be able to call them back.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I have a consistent issue with messing up the names of my functions in a minor way so that when I reference them to call back later, they never work because the name doesn't match. Took me a while to reread it all and sort it out. I usually end up having my lab partner look through my function codes to make sure they all match up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the file I created as well as the program executed, edited with CSS to make it look snazzy and match the previous labs aesthetic.</p>
